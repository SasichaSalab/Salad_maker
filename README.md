## Getting Started

To get started with the Salad Maker project, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project. Inside this file, add the following line:

   ```plaintext
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api

   ## Deploy on Vercel

   The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

   Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```plaintext
   npm install next react react-dom

3. **Start the Development Server**
   ```plaintext
   npx next dev

   This command will start the Next.js development server, and you can access the application at http://localhost:3000.
